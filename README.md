# country-population-and-health-data-analysing
The purpose of this project is to analyze population and health data of different countries and predict the next year population using machine learning techniques. The data will be visualized using Power BI and uploaded to GitHub for easy access.
Data Source: The data source for this project will be publicly available datasets from the World Bank. The data will include population data, health data, and other related information for different countries. The data will be downloaded in CSV format and stored locally for analysis.
Tools: The following tools will be used for this project:
•	Python: for data preprocessing, data cleaning, and machine learning model development.
•	Power BI: for data visualization and dashboard creation.
•	GitHub: for storing and sharing the code and data.
Data Preprocessing: The data will be preprocessed to remove any missing or duplicate values. The data will be cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. The data will be transformed as required to make it suitable for analysis.
Machine Learning: The machine learning model will be developed using Python. The model will be trained using historical population data and health data. The model will use regression techniques to predict the next year's population based on the current year's data.
Data Visualization: The predicted population data will be visualized using Power BI. The visualization will include charts, graphs, and tables to show the trends in population growth and health indicators. The dashboard will be designed to be user-friendly and interactive.
GitHub: The code and data for this project will be uploaded to GitHub for easy access and sharing. The code will be well-documented to make it easy for other users to understand and use.
Conclusion: This project aims to predict the next year's population using machine learning techniques and analyze the data using Power BI. The project will provide insights into population growth and health indicators and will be shared on GitHub for easy access and sharing.
